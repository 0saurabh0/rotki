# Get LP events queries
# TODO: At the moment there are no protocol fees. However, it is possible they
# turn them on in a future. The fees (from `feeTo` field in both `mints` and
# `burns` schemas) would be already factorized in the events amounts.
# Requesting and storing them in DB would just be for informing the user.
